#Banner Admin Pages -- Common

This repository is part of the set of repositories that makes up the source code for the Java-based administrative pages (UI) for Banner, also known as the "transformed pages" since they were originally transformed from their predecessor Banner 8.x Oracle Forms.

The Common repository contains source code and build specifications for the common libraries and "General common" pages.
